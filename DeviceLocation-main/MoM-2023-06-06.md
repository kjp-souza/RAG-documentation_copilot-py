## Open issues and PRs

### Alignment with guidelines

* [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12)

* New model for `ueId`/`device` defined in [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand), including new model for IPv4Address. 
  
* New PR #61 [https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/61]. Reviewed by Orange 
* **Merge planned June 7th EOB if no blocking comment**

### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)

* Discussed in [Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/156)
  - New model now consolidated in Guidelines.
  - New [PR in QoD](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/155) with a similar alignment to guidelines. It could be taken as example.

* [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49) by @maxl2287 (DT) needs to be adapted. * 	**DT will continue the crafting work**
 
* Need discussion if Geo fence should be separated from check location operation as distinct model/business case could be provided. 
  - **Ludovic will create an issue to capture team feedback.**


### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  
* Agreed to have a separate API from the current one
  - Proposal to move current one to a new basePath, e.g. `device-location-verification`, and leave `device-location` to this new one
  - Issue [#59](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/59). **To discuss during meeting**

* Review PR by Ludovic
  - Discussion about modelling endpoint as POST vs GET in [Commonalities Issue #212](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/212)
  - Seems there is consensus about using POST for use cases like this one
  - Some comments and fixes in PR.
  - Discussion in meeting about link with consent in particular when the location requested is for IoT - there is an Identity & Consent Management project where discussion occurs

* **Merge planned June 7th EOB if no blocking comment.**

### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Some comments on the issue, no comments on PR

* **@all, please provide comments to PR**
  - Need additional work to be completed as it is not 100% clear

### Consolidate documentation into spec

* Adopt [decision in Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164) about keeping API documentation as part of the spec

* **@José will make it but after subscription is closed (and implemented)**
* **@Ludovic will make for the 'raw' location API**

### Units for radius

* [Issue #52](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/52). Review doc/guidelines about units
  - OK for doc enhancement
  - Need to check if we are using meter or kilometer.
  
* [Issue #60](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/60)
  - Discuss during meeting:	Depending on the back end - glmc (meter accuracy) or nef - the accuracy is very different

* **Ask for team to provide comments in issue**

### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - No comments so far
  - Discuss during meeting: We need to provide a hint that the precision request is (definitely) too fine for API provider

* **Ask for team to provide comments in issue**

### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.
* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in June featuring 
    - For check location: 
      - Rename location to location-verification (issue 59)
      - Align device model (PR 61)
      - Add documentation in the OAS
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS
  - Release in August 
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* TEF keeps the PR on hold. 

* **TEF will move discussion to business track in GSMA (@Jorge)**
