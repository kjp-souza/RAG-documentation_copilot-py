## Discussion

| Agenda Item | Description | Discussion & Action Points |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Alignment with guidelines | [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12). We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines<br> - Waiting for new model for `ueId`/`device` to be consolidated in  [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand) WG. Expected for next weeks | - QoD finally [merged changes, renaming `ueId` to `device`](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/code/API_definitions/qod-api.yaml)<br> - Wait for agreement on IP description<br> - **@jlurien will make a PR for this**  |
| Subscription for Location Area | [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)<br> - Some feedback by Orange and Telefónica<br> - Some pending comments: Add DELETE and GET, support for subscription termination due to consent removal (new event?)<br> - New PR proposed to `main` branch by @maxl2287 (DT), as previous one [#27](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/27) was closed | - Some agreement reached in [Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/156)<br> - Still pending question about location<br> - **PR once agreed (Max or Ludovic)** |
| Add `maxAge` | [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34)<br> - Feedback from Telefónica<br> - LastLocationTime makes sense for B2B UB but team agreed that privacy constraint need to be considered <br> - Also proposed as [Issue #42](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/42), so closed as duplicated <br> - Wait for clear requirement to complete model | - Last days for the comments for #34<br> - **@Akos will then make the PR** |
| Postal Code Area | [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)<br> - Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area<br> - Discussion on the model, as other code could be used (like INSEE code in France)<br> - Model could accommodate to have several type of code, but our polymorphic model also allow us to be precise.<br> - No additional requirement from Orange on INSEE code used in France | <br> - Alignment on country code terminology (from Akos review) - **@jlurien will update the PR**<br> - José reminds the business rational for adding postal code. All implementation must support circle area. All other area support is optional |
| Provide location | [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [Commonalities Issue #178](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/178)<br> - Also new [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) may be related<br> - Proposal by Ericsson, feedback by DT and TEF <br> - The use case is interesting. Get more details from Product teams<br> - We agree that is a specific endpoint - discussion about adding it to the current API or have a separate API. Version management should be taken into account. Raised an issue in Commonalities about "multiple endpoint API" vs "multiple API - Feedback from TEF and DT | - One or 2 APIs? Issue still open in Commonalities. From Telefonica & Orange preference to have 2 APIs on this UC to clearly separate check location from getting location. José rational for 2 APIs is to simplify release management. Joachim explained that from Ericsson they have separated in 2 APIs for security reason & distinct UC. <br> - **Get DT feedback on this specific API** if comfortable with 1 or 2 APIs.<br> - **@Ludovic can do a first PR for that once DT provide feedback**. We can have 2 yaml in API_definitions. Current yaml for location check need to be slightly revisited (naming, example, scope) |
