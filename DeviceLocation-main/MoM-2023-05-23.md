* New model for `ueId`/`device` defined in [QualityOnDemand](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand), including new model for IPv4Address. Already merged
  
* **@jlurien will make a PR for this**  Still pending

### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)

* Discussed in [Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/156)
  - Ludovic updated the guidelines accordingly. Now waiting for the merge in Commonalities, pending on discussion for Guidelines versioning.
  
* **PR once agreed (Ludovic)**  -> Pending, Ludovic updated by email that he's ok with versioning proposal.

### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  - Also [Issue #43](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/43) may be related -> **@ukkaps to clarify**
  
* Agreed to have a separate API from the current one
  - Proposal to move current one to a new basePath, e.g. `device-location-verification`, and leave `device-location` to this new one
  - **@jlurien to open issue to discuss new name**

* Review PR by Ludovic
  - Discussion about modelling endpoint as POST vs GET in [Commonalities Issue #212](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/212)
  - Seems there is consensus about using POST for use cases like this one
  - Opinions, further comments on the PR?
  - **@Ludovic Ludovic will modify the spec** |

### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Some comments on the issue, no comments on PR

* **@all, please provide comments to PR**

### Consolidate documentation into spec

* Adopt [decision in Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164) about keeping API documentation as part of the spec

* **@José will make it but after subscription is closed (and implemented)** -> Pending

### Units for radius

* [Issue #52](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/52). Review doc/guidelines about units
  - OK for doc enhancement
  - Need to check if we are using meter or kilometer.
  
* **@Jose to open new issue** 

### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* TEF keeps the PR on hold

## AOB

* Some questions about general topics of CAMARA, not directly related to Device Location. Pointing to the right place to raise that questions.

* DT ask for time planning for new Release. Agreed to open an issue with tentative scope and roadmap, as they did in QoD. **AP on @jlurien**

* Joachim comments about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - Current proposal is not clear about that
  - **Joachim to open issue**

<p>

**Next call is on June 6th.**
