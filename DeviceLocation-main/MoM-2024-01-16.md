### Review other Issues and PRs

#### New

  - [Geofencing API - Add Subscription type 'area-left-or-entered' to subscribe to both event in one time](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/138)
    - Review comments
      - José answers in the PR
      - Joachim agreed on the fact that make sense to have one event type both for left & entered
      - Akos: The UC is clear - how we solve it
      - One approach is to allow to subscribe to an array of event type
        - Discussed in the past but adding an array of notification type will add a layer of complexity to manage a subscription
        - Could be a problem if the server is not able to manago one kind of event type. 
    - **Keep it open to let the discussion open.**
      - José will also check with development team
        - Having both 'event' in one notification type could have an impact on the server managing the event

  - [Revise Description to Meet GDPR Compliance - REMOVAL OF " Location-based advertising" in Documentation](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/135)
    - Review comments
    - Nicholas will propose a better wording for this sentence
      - Could be integrated in rc2

  - [Define guidelines for geofencing implementation](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/133)
    - Review comments
    - Need more review from the team
    - Correlation with issue [Geofencing API - Defining a standard behavior for first event](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/124)
    - **keep the discussion open**

#### Ongoing

* [Add Test Definition for location Retrieval #119](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/119/files)
  - Link with Commonalities here: https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/94
  - Review PR status
  - Proposal to use this one as the 'model sample' for Commonalities
  - **Keep in open but need to be prioritized**

* [Implement use of linting rule set for Device Location API](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/125)
  - Next steps
    - Integrate the linting in our CI as for QoD
    - As codeowner we did not have the right to add it.
    - José will comment and ping Markus & Rafal to ask them how we can move forward.

* [Geofencing API - Defining a standard behavior for first event](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/124)
  - Review comments, next steps
  - Probably same thing must be done for area left. 
    - Akos & Ludovic have UC where it could be necessary.
    - Nicholas mentionned also ad-based UC  (ad in a podcast location-based for example) where we want to control the time when the ad should be triggered for a device

* [Geofencing API - Add "format: uri" to notificationUrl](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/118)
  - Moved to [commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/93)
  - still open in Commonalities

* [Geofencing API - Adding capability to manage max number of notification](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/111)
  - Moved to [commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/90)
  - still open - no progress in Commonalities


### Open discussions

#### Administrative Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track
  - New [document uploaded by TEF](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/files/12856149/AdminCode.Proposal.-.Draft_20230926.docx) with a proposal
* [action] Review this document. 
    - Not progress but during last call we agreed that this feature is not top priority right now but will be discussed next year.
  - Probably to keep it close with the (future) work for User Device count 
  - We can probably add our Area schemas in Commonalities


#### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - As requested by Joachim, issue will remain open until TEF uploads the document with more detail or the information is added to an API_documentation file to keep in the repo for future references.
