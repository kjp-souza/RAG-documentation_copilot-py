* [Geofencing API - Add Subscription type 'area-left-or-entered' to subscribe to both event in one time](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/138)

  Discussed during previous meeting:
  - Alignement with device status was discussed.

  - No specific issue created so far in Commonalities, but mentioned in [issue](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/140) about CloudEvents Subscription format. 
  - This is not an urgent issue as functionality can be covered with current events, so we may wait until discussions in Commonalities advance.


* [Define guidelines for geofencing implementation](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/133)
  - No new comments.
  - Connected with [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85). A document with implementation guideline should cover this also.


* [Geofencing API - Adding capability to manage max number of notification](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/111)
  - Moved to [commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/90)
  - New [PR](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/131) -> Still nor merged but seems to have all LGTM. AP: Double check with Ludovic

  - Moved to Commonalities [Issue 140](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/140)
  - No comments in the issue in the last 2 weeks
  - Discussed during the meeting if we should wait for Commonalities for a common format, or add parameters in our current model nad adapt later to approved guidelines.
    - As we are starting cycle for a new release, we can wait for the moment. Eventually, if we are about to release something new and commonalities are not agreed, we can tale the lead.

  - [Document uploaded by TEF](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/files/12856149/AdminCode.Proposal.-.Draft_20230926.docx) with a proposal. 

  This item should be reopen after MWC.

  - We should discussed approach on this for next release. Should we incorporate this to current operations, should we split this functionality to new endpoints or even separate APIs?

#### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - As requested by Joachim, issue will remain open until TEF uploads the document with more detail or the information is added to an API_documentation file to keep in the repo for future references.

## AOB

  - Joachim asked for plans or roadmap for R1.0
  - Jose commented that there is still no roadmap or time frame agreed for v1.0, but release plan for R1.0 should be agreed at CAMARA project level.
  - At WG level we may discuss the content for next release, being 0.x or 1.x. So far we only have the requirement for Administrative Codes, but others may come from GSMA product track
