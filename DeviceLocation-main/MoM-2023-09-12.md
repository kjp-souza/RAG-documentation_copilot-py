## Agenda

* Any other business

## Open issues and PRs


### Location Retrieval, v0.1-wip (Get raw location)

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  - Merged but any comment are welcome
  - Joachim: Maybe we should consider to send back other area than circle.
This is only in the response -> **@Joachim will raise an issue**
 
### Geofencing v0.1-wip (Subscription for Location Area) 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #74](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/74)
  - Notification pattern is still in progress in Commonalities to accommodate use of [CloudEvents](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/56) -> Once the model close in Commonalities should be quick to craft the API.
  

### Roadmap to Release v0.2

* The proposed process for a version is to have a version x.y-wip then x.y-rc and then finally released as x.y. This pattern is used in QoD.

* Align the Device Location API with the security schema as described in Unify specification of `securitySchemes`, `security` and scopes, [Commonalities Issue #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/53), [PR #57](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/57)
  - PR still not merged, we should wait until Commonalities are approved.

* Next steps:
  - Then create v0.2-rc for location-verification, updating Changelog and Release notes.
  - Add location-retrieval v0.1.0-wip 
  - Add geofencing v0.1.0-wip, after discussion in Commonalities is closed.  

* Joachim asked the question about consistence between the release name and the API name.
  - Perhaps we can have a name for a family release
  - Good topic to release in Commonalities -> **@Ludovic will raise an issue in Commonalities**

### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 

* New [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - TEF provided a doc with a proposal and use cases for the implementation of 'Partial' and matchRate

* Discussion during meeting:
  - Ludovic provided comment on José document
  - The first point is to be aligned on the matchRate formulae.
  - Both TEF & Orange feedbacks are that most of the result will be false or partial but very few chance to get True result.
  - The problem is more significant if we allow 'small' scope (minimum radius)
  - Good to keep in open 
  - **@Ludovic will fix the comment - should be matchRate no maxRate**
  - Joachim: other alternative will be to answer the True/False but also the location
    - This is not easy for Privacy issue
    - We have the 'other' API to trigger this.
  - Javier look on Ludovic proposal: could have worst result but in same time current approach did not cover all the case.
  - After discussion seems that the team direction is to work on the PARTIAL answer and differentiate depending on the situation (see José document UC 3 & 4 for example). The PARTIAL  answer could be completed with additional information
  - **Think about improving PARTIAL information for next version**

### Administrative Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track
  - Old [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47) closed.

* No new comments since last meeting, **no update or discussion during meeting**. Previous questions/doubts:
  - How to handle the 'diversity' of the 'geo' code that we can have in a given country.
  - How to discover what is implemented by each provider.
  - Error scenario must be defined in CAMARA if the area type requested is not supported by the telco.
