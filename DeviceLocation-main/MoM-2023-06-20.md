## Agenda

* Open issues and PRs
* Any other business

## Open issues and PRs

### Alignment with guidelines

* [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15) closed. 
* [PR #61](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/61) merged.


### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #49](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/49)
  - To be aligned with Commonalities
  - **DT will continue the crafting work**
 
* [Issue #64](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/64): Discussion if Geo fence should be separated from check location operation as distinct model/business case could be provided. 
  - **Team Decision**: We will have 2 APIS - Ludovic will comment issue & close it.
  - Current Device location verification will stay only with one operation
  - PR #49 should be close
  - Need a discussion about the name


### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  
* Agreed to have a separate API from the current one
  - [Issue #59](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/59), [PR #66](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/66)
  - `device-location-verification` or `location-verification`: **Team Decision**: remove device prefix

* Review PR by Ludovic
  - **Team Decision**: need to switch to meter, related to [Issue #60](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/60)
  - Discussion on age of location:
    - Depends on the UC. If we do not provide age of location we need to have a global rule about retrieval delay

* **Team Decision**: Regarding the date related parameters
  - `lastLocationTime` in the response mandatory
  - `maxAge` will be optional in the request

* Documentation will be handled in a second PR for raw location
  
* Another API could be to have a history API but data are not obviously available from network. If needed, it is a separate use case.


### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Some comments on the issue, no comments on PR

* **Team Decision** Regarding the date related parameters:
  - `lastLocationTime` in the response mandatory
  - `maxAge` will be optional in the request
  - Add explicit information of maxAge about the fact that its concerns only the last location
  - `maxAge` will be in second with a minimum of 60.

* [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53) will be aligned. @José will comment
* @Ludovic will align raw location API


### Consolidate documentation into spec

* Adopt [decision in Commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/164) about keeping API documentation as part of the spec

* **@José will make it but after subscription is closed (and implemented)** -> Pending
* **@Ludovic will make for the 'raw' location API**, separate PR after [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55) 

### Units for radius
 
* [Issue #60](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/60)
  - Discuss during meeting:	Depending on the back end - glmc (meter accuracy) or nef - the accuracy is very different

* **Team decision**: Move to meters

### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - No comments so far
  - Discuss during meeting: We need to provide a hint that the precision request is (definitely) too fine for API provider

* **Ask for team to provide comments in issue** 
  - Need to check how current system manage when the accuracy is to small - always False?
  - Need additional discussion


### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.
* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in June featuring 
    - For check location: 
      - Rename location to location-verification (issue 59) -> PR
      - ~~Align device model (PR 61)~~
      - Add documentation in the OAS -> Pending PR
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS
  - Release in August 
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

* From roadmap perspective we are on track for API definition - for the documentation it could be probably delivered in July. 

### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* TEF has moved discussion to business track in GSMA. Any update?
  - Not yet, @Jorge provides update on business track.
