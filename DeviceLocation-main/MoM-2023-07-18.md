## Agenda

* Open issues and PRs
* Any other business

## Open issues and PRs


### Subscription for Location Area 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #74](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/74)
  - Old PR #49 was close, new PR created
  - Many comments, most resolved. Ongoing discussions in Commonalities may affect this PR.
  - Probably better to **stick to current design** and then adjust later.
  - DT team keeps the design aligned with Device Status API.
  - Ludovic Robert will make a review of his previous comments to close resolved one

 
* [Issue #69](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/69): Proposal for new name
  - Orange preference for `location-verification-subscription`, Ericsson preference for `geofencing`
  - Joachim Dahlgren provided rational for geofencing instead of location-verification-subscription as we can have a second location subscription feature for geotracking.
  - DT as owner of this API will consider this naming proposal and get back to the team (Akos Hunyadi)
  - Looking for team feedback



### New API to provide raw location

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  - Most comments resolved
  - José  Luis Urien Pinedo will make a final review
  - Ludovic will work on the documentation only once PR#55 has been merged to avoid 


### Add new parameter `maxAge` 

* [Issue #34](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/34), [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53)

* Agreed:
  - `lastLocationTime` in the response mandatory
  - `maxAge` will be optional in the request
  - Add explicit information of maxAge about the fact that its concerns only the last location
  - `maxAge` will be in second with a minimum of 60.

* Comments in [PR #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/53). It must be rebased, or close this and new PR
  - ** @DT will discuss with the team how to process (rebase or new PR) ** -> José will check but the rebase has probably been already done
* Applied to [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)


### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
  - No new comments
  - From previous meeting: We need to provide a hint that the precision request is (definitely) too fine for API provider, need to check how current system manage when the accuracy is to small - always False?

* To be discussed during meeting.
  - ** @TEF will provide examples about 'Partial' UC ** -> Some internal discussions, José will post some material to illustrate the problem;
  - We need to align on the formula to calculate the 'matchRate' for PARTIAL answer


### Roadmap for Release v0.2

* We have to decide in Commonalities how to communicate roadmap for multiple API project.
* Our roadmap could be: 
  - Release in July featuring 
    - For check location: -> ready for 0.2
      - ~~Rename location to location-verification (issue 59)~~
      - ~~Align device model (PR 61)~~
      - ~~Add documentation in the OAS~~
    - For raw location: 
      - Provide v0.1 -> ready to be merged - documentation will be tackled in a separate PR
      - With documentation integrated in the OAS -> Pending PR
  - Release in August / September (depending on holidays):  
    - Adding location subscription/notification for checking location

* From roadmap perspective we are on track for API definition - for the documentation it could be probably delivered in July. 


### Postal Code Area

* [Issue #39](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/39), [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47)

* Proposal by TEF to add Postal Codes as new type of area, lack of support from other partners about the business case

* New request from GSMA to add administrative code (like postal code)
  - How we will manage case where implementation did not provide all location type?, Discovery?, Error?

* **@TEF: add a new issue and close this one.** -> Pending
 
* Discussion on how to handle the 'diversity' of the 'geo' code that we can have in a given country.

* How a developer will know the 'type' of area managed by a telco
  - José mentioned discussion about TMF Catalog API (as operate API) - As a discovery feature.
  - An error scenario must be defined in CAMARA if the area type requested is not supported by the telco


## Test Cases

* New [Issue #80](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/80)

* Wait for other working group & commonalities agreement alignment

* Discussion about use of Gherkin + specific implementation
  - Gherkin file should (must?) be provided
  - Specific language implementation file could be provided but as part of implementation contribution
 

## Accuracy Levels for Device Location APIs

* New [Issue #78](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/78)
  - Discuss if we need this functionality

* José/Ludovic not sure about the relevance of the problem with current technology as we're not able to provide 'fine-grain' location.

* Joachim raised that if we have this capabilities to provide coarse vs fine we'll have a consent issue that cannot be at 'global' api level but dependent on the accuracy


## Summer 2023 presence

* New [PR #75](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/75)
  - Only Ludovic added this presence

* Keep Aug 1st - José will host.
* Skip Aug 15th …. except of someone volunteer to host it


<p>

**Next call is on August 1st**
