## Open issues and PRs


### Location Retrieval, v0.1-wip (Get raw location)

* [Issue #40](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/40), [PR #55](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/55)
  - Official name to be location-retrieval
  - Reviewed, has 2 approvals. Decided to merge!
  - Ludovic will work on the documentation only once PR#55 has been merged


### Geofencing v0.1-wip (Subscription for Location Area) 

* [Issue #18](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/18), [PR #74](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/74)
  - Ludovic provided feedback on notification discussion in Commonalities, progress & plan:
    - Have a specific swagger for generic notification
    -	Format for this dedicated notification swagger --> probably use Cloud Event structure
    - Use of callbacks clause in the API swagger to describe API notification
    - Issue API Design for "Resource-based subscription", [Commonalities Issue #44](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/44) is the good place to follow progress
  - Some comments still pending
  - Probably for next meeting we can align Geofencing with commonalities 
  - Close to be merged as v0.1.0-wip, inline doc to be added later 


### Roadmap to Release v0.2

* The proposed process for a version is to have a version x.y-wip then x.y-rc and then finally released as x.y. This pattern is used in QoD.
* Align the Device Location API with the security schema as described in Unify specification of `securitySchemes`, `security` and scopes, [Commonalities Issue #53](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/53)
* Next steps:
  - Create v0.2-rc for location-verification, updating Changelog and Release notes.
  - Add location-retrieval v0.1.0-wip 
  - Add geofencing v0.1.0-wip, if aligned with Commonalities   
  - Give a couple of weeks for final testing and comments
  - Approve a release after next meeting


### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #58](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/58) about what is expected behaviour when requested accuracy is more restrictive that the one that network is able to satisfy. 
* New [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - TEF provided a doc with a proposal and use cases for the implementation of 'Partial' and matchRate
  - Further discussion needed. Orange team will make a review.

### Administrative Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track
  - Old [PR #47](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/47) to be closed when new one is created.
* No new comments since last meeting, same questions/doubts:
  - How to handle the 'diversity' of the 'geo' code that we can have in a given country.
  - How to discover what is implemented by each provider.
  - Error scenario must be defined in CAMARA if the area type requested is not supported by the telco.
* Discussion during the meeting:
  - These questions could have a larger magnitude than this Device location API and should also infuse in Commonalities
  - Adding Open Gateway product in the discussion could make sense as this OPGW could probably restrict a CAMARA API capability
  - Discussion on the 'critical mass' to introduce API or API capability within one country.
