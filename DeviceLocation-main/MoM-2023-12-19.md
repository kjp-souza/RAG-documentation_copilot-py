* Review latest comments in PR for README and CHANGELOG, and decide if ready to be merged:
  - [Release Notes](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/106)
  - *Links will work after branch for Release-0.2.0 is created*
  - No new comment since last meeting
  - José will take a last look and merge this PR.

### Review other Issues and PRs

#### New

* [Implement use of linting rule set for Device Location API](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/125)
  - José tested locally for location verification
  - José plans to do same for the other APIs
  - No major issue identified (only warning).

* [Geofencing API - Defining a standard behavior for first event](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/124)
  - Relevant question for possible enhancement. To be discussed.
  - José took a look on google API implementation and they have a new input parameter to let client decide if she/he decide to get an event at subscription time. This is relevant only for entered area event. 
    - We can introduce a `initialTriggerAreaEntered` boolean - if it is true then a notification is sent if the mobile is within the area.
    - Akos said that we can send the notification in every case (not requiring this attribute)
    - Joachim raises the point about how we can distinct the fact that the device was already in the area vs it just entered in for this first event.
      - A combination with Location retrieval could be also documented. Ludovic says that it can work except if the device just entered at subscription time.
  - **We need to open an issue to discuss** about the compute rule for geofencing area match. We solved this for device verification API (for `matchRate`) but here this is different as it is dynamic.
  - Recommendation to continue the discussion on the issue.

#### From previous meeting

* [Add Test Definition for location Retrieval #119](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/119/files)
  - Link with Commonalities here: https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/94
  - No progress
    - DT Team has provided comment
    - TEF team will also provide comments
  - Discussion should continue in Commonalities

* [Adjust IP Adresses device in device to use single IP adresses](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/117)
  - Already done, to be closed when merged
  - **Closed** with PR merging.

* [Geofencing API - Add "format: uri" to notificationUrl](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/118)
  - Moved to [commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/93)
  - still open

* [Geofencing API - Adding capability to manage max number of notification](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/111)
  - Moved to [commonalities](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/issues/90)
  - still open - no progress

* [security and scopes for the Device Location API](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/105)
  - Ludovic answered.
  - **Closed**

* [Documentation Updated](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/102)
  - part of https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/104
  - **Closed** with PR merging.

### Open discussions

#### Behaviour when requesting too high precision

* [Issue #85](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/85)
  - TEF provided a doc with a proposal and use cases for the implementation of 'Partial' and matchRate
  - During previous meeting we agreed to use the formula defined in the Word document.
  - Descriptions regarding partials and matchRate has been added in location-verification yaml
  - As requested by Joachim, issue will remain open until TEF uploads the document with more detail or the information is added to an API_documentation file to keep in the repo for future references.


#### Administrative Code Area

* New [Issue #83](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/83), with formal requirements from GSMA Product track
  - New [document uploaded by TEF](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/files/12856149/AdminCode.Proposal.-.Draft_20230926.docx) with a proposal
* [action] Review this document. 
    - Not progress but during last call we agreed that this feature is not top priority right now but will be discussed next year.
