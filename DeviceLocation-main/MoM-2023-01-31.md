## Discussion

| Agenda Item | Description | Discussion & Action Points |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Release management | Current version tagged as v0.1.0.<br>Versioning still being discussed in Commonalities.<br>We have a dev-v0.2.0 branch where new PRs are proposed, but other WGs are pulling PRs directly to main. | Waiting for decision on Commonalities and align with them |
| WoW | - First we should open a new issue to propose anything new. Get feedback and comments on issue.<br>- After some agreement, open a PR with details.<br>- To merge a PR we need at least 2 approvals, including Code Owners.  | Reminder on the 'rules of engagement' |
| Add `maxAge` | [PR #9](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/pull/9) proposing new request parameter. Discussion on the PR still open | - Discussion of parameter position - should be in request/response?<br> -	Tracking history of a location is not a API issue but related to network capabilities.<br> - UC: logistic to track shipment. Give access to people when they enter a building. Fraud tracking. Launching a app for a limited perimeter<br> - Reminder: this is not a 'precise' response as a minimum 2km radius is considered<br><br> **@Udaka triggers an issue & check with Geo fencing** |
| Alignment with guidelines | [Issue #15](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/15), related to [Issue #12](https://github.com/camaraproject/DeviceLocation/issues/12).<br> We must adapt errors and properties to guidelines | Waiting for decision on Commonalities and other WGs, and align with them |
| New points by DT | DT is currently working on an implementation against the nef and also I would love to discussss a new feature – subscription based tracking. | DT Improvements proposal:<br>-	Subscription based (when a sim card enters a perimeter)<br> - Add a new response value for 'unknown'<br>- Get the cell location for a device<br><br>**@DT: Create new issue for each of them** |
| Covering partial matches (TEF) | [Issue TBC] Current response with a single boolean leaves some ambiguous scenarios where there are partial matches. | - How to manage partial matches as several 'in middle' scenarios are possible<br><br> **@José (Telefonica) opens an issue for this.** |
